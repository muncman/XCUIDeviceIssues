/**
 * **tl;dr** Why can't `XCUIDevice` be relied on to query the current orientation of an app? What is the better way? (Is there one?)
 *
 * Run this test case, and first it will fail with the orientation being reported as Portrait.
 * Run it again (and again), and it will fail with the orientation as Face Up.
 *
 * # The Problem
 *
 * When creating UI tests, it can be beneficial to know which orientation the app is in,
 * as the set of interface elements are on-screen and accessible can vary (such as with split view controllers).
 * Leveraging the `XCUIDevice` API seems like the appropriate way to manage orientation for this purpose.
 * However, while _setting_ `orientation` works, `XCUIDevice` only reports back the original orientation
 * of the appliation within the simulator window.
 *
 * __It never updates which orientation it reports as current during a test run.__
 *
 * Therefore, if a given test scenario needs to ensure it is in Portrait for the assertions to be valid,
 * that testcase is not able to query for the current orientation.
 * Further, if a test scenario needs to rotate back and forth based on other conditions for a given workflow,
 * it cannot deduce if it the device/interface are already in the required orientation.
 *
 * This original orientation will likely be Portrait if the simulator just launched
 * (even if the simulator window actually launched to a landscape orienttation itself, Springboard will be in Portrait).
 * If you manually change the orientation of the simulator, that new orientation will be reported on the next run (only).
 *
 * This produces different results for the same test code, depending on environment and (potentially) from one run to the next.
 * And this is the opposite of what you want in a test suite. Reliable repeatability is key. `XCUIDevice` does not currently provide this.
 *
 * Blindly rotating at every possible need (such as in every `setUp()` invocation for a known starting orientation) has the cost of
 * having to wait for a rotation animation to complete -- whether an animation was present or not. This is _horrible_ for test run times.
 *
 * ## Other Notes
 * - Breaking variations of this test(s) into separate methods with `launch()` instead of `activate()` has no effect.
 * - `XCUIDevice()` vs. `XCUIDevice.shared` makes no difference in the results.
 * - `UIApplication.shared.statusBarOrientation` is not accessible in a UI test (and is deprecated anyway).
 * - Registering for `NSNotification.Name.UIApplicationDidChangeStatusBarOrientation` in an XCUITest is not a viable workaround, either.
 * - It can be helpful to have simulator device bezels visible during this test.
